title: Ushering a Prize
---

Unto the Duellists of Atlantia, and especially her noble Rapier Marshalls, an open letter from Baron Alan Gravesend and Master Geoffrey Gamble.

During the list and feast of Transylvania Travesty, we held some
sober divers discussions on the proper way to fight an individual
who is playing for his/her prize as a scholar (authorized
rapier fighter), and we felt it of value to share these thoughts
with our fellow duellists.  We divide our discourse in three parts:
safety, technique and general thoughts.  We seek to remind all
those who fill the role of authorizing fighter that they stand in
that moment for all the duellists of the kingdom, to test whether the
contestant after his/her prize is safe and worthy of advancement
in rank; to this end we suggest some ideas and tools which might be
used in an authorization bout.  These are not techniques that should
all be used in any one bout, but rather an assortment of tricks to
be used as appropriate.

We think it of value that the usher will, during the course of
the bout, attempt to encourage or even provoke unsafe behavior.  It is
unsafe for a fighter to make wild blade movements of a striking nature,
as this may lead to whipping or slapping.  In order to test this, we
suggest that the usher make a point of provoking wide parries and
slaps by using various outside attacks, and by broad prise de fer movements.
If there is a tendency to whip, these techniques may bring it out.  The
scholar candidate must not show any tendency to grab his/her opponent, to grapple,
wrestle, punch, or in the end, just freak out (which might also mean
freezing as well as becoming violent).  To test this, the usher should press
very hard, and very fast, with powerful attacks, even attacks which
are on the border of being unsafe themselves.  Such an attack should show
if the scholar can handle being pressed, whether he/she can keep themself
under control, and show also whether any blows thrown at close range are of
a safe force (i.e. if he's still throwing to full extension when you are 18
inches away, this is a problem).   Finally, we would suggest that two (or
more) holds be called under the following circumstances:  the first, a hold
out of the blue, just to see the response; the second, a hold carefully
timed to fall in the middle of a hard action, to see how quickly it
registers, and how the scholar responds.

We believe that the scholar who fails any of the above challenges is probably
(well, in some cases certainly) not ready to authorize.  In many cases it
will not be necessary to be so provocative in the course of playing the prize
-- the scholar's faults will be evident:  but if they are not so clear, by all
means, it is the duty of the usher to bring them out.

At a minimum, the free scholar should try a variety of attacks, coming from all lines,
to see that the scholar has a defense for each line.  Through the course of the prize,
the scholar should be faced with an increasing challenge, beginning exclusively with
simple attacks, and then adding feints, double disengages, and the like.  On the other
hand, this should not be carried too far; playing games with range and timing is
probably more than a scholar should have to deal with when playing his/her prize.
It is important for the free scholar to match his/her fight to the skill of the
contestant; there is, after all, no honor in winning an authorization bout, only in
conducting it fairly and thoroughly.  Another technique that should be evaluated it
that of blow calling.  A very scrupulous calibration should be conducted, of course,
and then the free scholar should make an effort to land some borderline shots in order
to see how they are called.  Examples would include tip cuts, short draw cuts or cuts
without movement of the blade, and "laying on of the tip" such as sometimes happens
when a fighter is off target and brings the blade in sideways and lays it over.  The
scholar's reaction should show not only that they are sensible of blows (sound or not),
but should also give some idea of their attitude towards "iffy" shots.  The free
scholar should also make an effort to vary his/her style during the fight, using
different guards and stances, and the scholar should be encouraged to fight in
something more period than modern strip fencing style.

These are a few ideas and tools that can be used in fighting authorization bouts, and
we hope you find them helpful.  It should be clear that the above techniques are not
ones that every authorized duellist in the kingdom can be expected to employ effectively
(or even safely!).  Thus it behooves the marshalls to choose the free scholar who will
play the prize with great care.  One possible route to take would be to require the free
scholar to be a rapier marshall.  The objection that there are too few rapier marshalls
around for it to be realistic to require three marshalls to authorize a fighter might be
met through the appointment of field marshalls for this purpose, as outlined in the
Atlantian Marshalls Handbook.  We hope that it will not be necessary to do this.  On
the other hand, fighters too often use an authorization bout as a warm up before a
tourney or melee.  This is a disservice to the scholar, and to the other duellists of the kingdom.

We have all heard of kingdoms who reject scholars on the basis of vaguely stated "lack of style,"
and we have all seen authorizations that were purely pro forma; let us give Atlantian Duello
something in between -- a true test, on rational grounds, of a scholar's safety and skill.  There
is a great difference between adding another name to the list of authorized duellists and making
a free scholar.  It is the responsibility of every free scholar playing the prize to see that the
new free scholar he/she makes will be a joy to watch and a true challenge to fight.
