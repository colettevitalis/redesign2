<!-- This document was created with Notepad -->

Knowing that he had a "good thing" (tm) going, Lord Philip Bell again commissioned
a set of poems to dedicate at the Atlantian Rapier Melee Tournament held at
Pennsic XXVI.  The first part was read as a pledge from all entrants in the tournament,
the response was then read by HRM Bera Thorbjarnardottir as her response to the fighters.

Notes from the Author, Mar Yaakov:

* Read *across*, not down one column then down the next
* Norse and Old English poetry uses a device called "kennings" where a metaphor substitutes for the actual word.  Thus, "soul-windows" for eyes or "land-whales" for cattle.

### Pledge of the Rapiers at the Queen's Tournament:

*by Mar Yaakov HaMizrachi*

Hear wire-warriors <BR>
Words of war now <BR>
Brave beautiful <BR>
Slayer, spear-queen <BR>
Consort of Cuan <BR>
Foreign foemen <BR>
To butcher like land-whales <BR>
Our war-wires strike <BR>
Atlantia's enemies <BR>
Dear spear-slayer <BR>
Search our soul-windows <BR>
Your beauty inspires <BR>
Your bravery binds us <BR>
Peerless Pearl-queen <BR>
Or ravening ravens <BR>

ware to our wyrd <BR>
weave we for Bera <BR>
bane of sword-foes <BR>
swear we now stoutly <BR>
we conquer for you <BR>
we fearlessly face <BR>
life-blood spilling <BR>
steel-waves washing over <BR>
like lemmings drown <BR>
doubt not our swearing <BR>
see we are yours <BR>
our boldness for battle <BR>
to beat down your foes <BR>
we promise you victory <BR>
will ravage our bones

### The Queen's Response

*by Mar Yaakov HaMizrachi*

Hear my fencers <BR>
But bitter is victory <BR>
No fame or bard-song <BR>
Oaths you have sworn <BR>
Fearing no death <BR>
Better to die <BR>
Then live disgraced <BR>
In life or death <BR>
And word-fame will follow

you fill me with pride <BR>
bought with dishonor <BR>
from foils of shame <BR>
see you fulfill them <BR>
fighting with honor <BR>
by blows of war-wire <BR>
belying your word <BR>
but deal with honor <BR>
Whatever befalls
