By **Dominyk Wolferam**

*Chris Cunning*:  [knocks on table with gavel] I hereby table the discussion regarding "where the rum has gone".<br>
*Giacamo*:  I like rum!<br>
*Cunning*:  We are aware. And speaking of things Giacomo likes; with regard to last Pennsic I would like to take a vote banning him from using metaphors of any kind. Especially in the presence of the Dragoons.<br>
*Giacomo*:  Hey that's not fair! That would be like...<br>
*All Provosts*:  NOOOOOO!<br>
*Giacomo*:  Now wait a minute that was a simile [pouts]<br>
*Connor*: [whispering]What were you going to say?<br>
*Giacomo*: [Tackles Chris]<br>

*Alejandro*: [Talking to Aedan, paying no attention to Chris]You are totally more bald than me.<br>
*Aedan*: Am not, I shaved my head, I have no hair by choice<br>
*Percy*: Guys give it a rest. Chris looks more bald than both of you anyway...<br>
*Chris*: [from the floor after being tackled by Giacomo]Hey!<br>
*Aedan*:  That's true<br>
*Alan*:  Mmmmm [raises eyebrow]<br>

*Chris*: [after picking himself up] Now let's discuss people who are ready for elevation.<br>
*Marcellus*:  What do you guys think about Belphoebe?<br>
*Vyvyan*:  My codpiece is bigger.<br>
*Giacomo*: [tackles Vyvian's codpiece]<br>
*Chris*:  OK no more nominating your spouses or significant others, especially if they have already been elevated [glares at Robert]<br>
*Robert*:  She makes me do it, I swear!<br>
*Chris*: Whatever. And no more nominating other peoples spouses or significant others, regardless of how.....familiar... you are with them [glares at Connor]<br>
*Connor*: [busily studies the gigantic pixie stick he has been working on]<br>
*Alan*:  Mmmmm [raises eyebrow]<br>

*Sir Christian*:  Can we talk about fencing now?<br>
*Rosalind*:  Gawd Christian, you always want to talk about fencing. You're not a Free Scholar anymore you know.<br>
*Sir Christian*:  Isn't that why we have these meetings?<br>
*Aedan*:  No no. We have these meetings to discuss raiding schedules, where to get the best equipment drops, upcoming version patches....<br>
*Rosalind*:  Umm I think those are your WoW guild meetings.<br>
*Aedan*:  Hhhhm [shrugs] (This noise and gesture combination has been patented by Imaprovostandyournot LLC. and has been depicted with permission)<br>

*Isobel*:  Before we talk about fencing we do need to discuss some issues regarding our appearance off the list. Connor you might want to pay attention to this one.<br>
*Connor*: [nods and puts attentive expression on his face while discreetly turning up the volume on his iPod]<br>
*Isobel*:  First I would like to say that Alejandro's new Persian garb is quite fantastic.<br>
*Alejandro*: [beams] Thank you<br>
*Kynny*:  Yeah. So what did you bring Al? Gold, incense or myrrh?<br>
*Alejandro*:  Why you.....I challenge you to a rugby match at dawn!!<br>
*Kynny*: .....you know how I know you're gay?<br>
*Chris*:  Guys chill out or Giacomo will tackle you<br>
*Giacomo*: [eyes shift dangerously back and forth between Kynny and Alejandro]<br>
*Nathanial*:  [from the snack table] Hey! Who took the last of the smoked salmon?<br>
*Giacomo*: [tackles the snack table]<br>
*Connor*: [singing loudly] I FELL INTO THE BURNING RING OF FI.....[realizes he's singing out loud]<br>
*Everyone*: [stares]<br>
*Connor*:  It's a Ramstein cover I swear! [pouts and skips to the next track on iPod]<br>
*Giacomo*: [tackles Connor's pixie stick]<br>

*Isobel*:  Anyway we need to discuss the issue of sunglasses being worn on the field.<br>
*Everyone except Robert*:  [groans]<br>
*Robert*:  Now come on people it's important for us to look authentic while on site. We have to set an example for...<br>

*FOOMP* [Roberts two foot starched neck ruff looses structural integrity and snaps straight up in the air giving an upside down lampshade effect]<br>

*Robert*:  Mrfl<br>
*Chris*: And that's Time. [clicks "stop" on a stopwatch]<br>
*Chris*:  Official time is fourteen minutes forty-two seconds. Who had fourteen thirty?<br>
*Melchior*:  I did!<br>
*Chris*:  You win the pot for this meeting. And the prize is....an extra large tube of Ben-Gay!<br>
*Percy*:  Lucky bastard!<br>
*Robert*:  Mrfl<br>
*Isobel*:  Now we have got to stop this! Every meeting you make bets on Roberts neck ruff, it's ridiculous!<br>
*Llwyd*:  You're just bitter because you had 15 minutes.<br>
