I do not want this schlager sword<BR>
I do not want it, Lord Sanford<BR>

I will not use it in a moat<BR>
I would not, could not on a boat<BR>

I do not want it in a castle<BR>
A schlager qual is too much hassle<BR>

I will not fence it at the war<BR>
I just like my epee more<BR>

I will not use it in a duel<BR>
I do not want to look the fool<BR>

I will not fence it at Queen's Champs<BR>
When I hold it, my hand cramps<BR>

I will not take a schlager class<BR>
Teach something else or I'll just pass<BR>

Epees are so fast and light<BR>
They just feel so nice and right<BR>

The schlager sword just moves too slow<BR>
I do not like it -- no, no, no<BR>

I do not want this schlager sword<BR>
I do not want it, Lord Sanford<BR>

> You do not like it, so you say<BR>
> Try the schlager and you may<BR>
> Try it, and you may, I say<BR>

> Feel the way that schlagers play<BR>
> Try it and you won't say nay<BR>
> Try the sword right now -- today<BR>

Say, I *do* like my schlager sword<BR>
I do like it, Lord Sanford<BR>

I like to play the schlager way<BR>
I want to play more now -- today<BR>

I do like my schlager sword<BR>
Now I use Di Grassi's ward<BR>

I can use it with my cloak<BR>
I can fence with many folk<BR>

Twist my wrist and disengage<BR>
Schlager swords are all the rage<BR>

I could, I would at demos too<BR>
Mundanes can see what I can do<BR>

I can use it there and here<BR>
I can play in Ealdomere<BR>

And, of course, it looks so cool<BR>
Looks more like a proper duel<BR>

I *do* like my schlager sword,<BR>
I do like it, Lord Sanford<BR>
