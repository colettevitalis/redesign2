## The Science and History of Rapier Wounds and Deaths

*by Iolo FitzOwen and Christian Richard Dupre*

In rapier combat of the Society for Creative Anachronism,
we try to recreate that was done in Europe between 1450 and 1600. Most
of the foundation for our fighting style is modern fencing, with some
modifications for use of secondary weapons, draw cuts, and fighting in the
round. It has always been obvious that we have hit and parried in a
harder manner than in modern fencing.  Trying to decide just how hard
we had to be hit to simulate a real blow with a real weapon has been a recurring
problem.

Many false assumptions have been made on how difficult or easy it is to puncture
the human body. Assumptions on which parts of the body punctured easier,
and on how a person's build affected the seriousness of a blow were also
made. Unfortunately most discussions on these topics ended in deadlock due
to differing opinions which could not be supported with facts.

What we hope to achieve in this paper is a discussion of the physiology,
physics, and history of inflicting wounds with the rapier. This slightly
gory topic may help us to deliver and call blows with our bated blades more
appropriately, consistently, and realistically. We would like to stress
that we are going to deal with facts that can be proven or have been proven
and which leave little room for argument. Some of the information uncovered
in our research differ with the long-standing opinions of Don Iolo and myself.
In light of the facts, however, we are more than willing to change
our opinions to be consistent with reality. I hope you will accept
these findings with an open mind.

We will look at the &quot;two inch blow&quot; rule, how speed and the sharpness of
the weapon affects a blow, how difficult the human body is to penetrate,
and how people in real period fights were affected by different types of
wounds.

### HUMAN TESTING

First we will discuss the human body. For years people have said that we needed
to have some real weapons tests performed on a medium that would simulate
the body, but none were ever done. In preparing this paper we were going
to perform such tests, but in our research we discovered that good tests
had already been done with reliable results. Dr. Bernard Knight published
a paper on stab wounds entitled *Some Medicolegal Aspects of Stab Wounds* in Legal Medicine Annual, 1976. He is a medical examiner
and was able to perform his tests on human cadavers. These tests are excellent
for our purpose, and it would be difficult to make any better ones. The
results are both enlightening and surprising.

In his paper Dr. Knight states that *With a very sharp knife,
the amount of pressure necessary to penetrate the skin of the torso varied
from one half to three kilograms (about one to six and a half
pounds). He also states that the sharpness of the blade was the single
most important factor. A blade point sharpened to the maximum degree would
penetrate with about half a kilogram of pressure (slightly more than one
pound). When even slightly blunted, the pressure required rose rapidly
to between three and five kilograms. If very blunt, it would not penetrate
the skin at all with the pressure delivered by one hand. In our tests,
the pressure required to obtain a two inch bend in a number five(5) foil
was about four and a half (4 1/2) pounds. This is well within the range
required for a real weapon. We found this to be a pleasant surprise.

We must point out that the pressure in this phase of the experiment was being
applied very slowly, so speed of thrust was not a factor for these results.
When Dr. Knight introduced speed as a factor he found that when a more
realistic reenactment of the stabbing situation was simulated with a rapid
lunge at the skin surface, a dramatic alteration of the result was seen.
With the knife traveling at several feet per second, penetration occurred
so readily that no reading was recorded upon the scale of the instrument.
This was attributed to the inertia of the spring system, so that the
knife did not begin to move relative to the handle of the apparatus before
deep penetration was achieved. Once again this result changed with
the dullness of the blade, however the speed that the blade travels profoundly
affects the ease of penetration. Therefore, if a rapier penetrates
easily at high speed, it would do so before it had time to bend, or the skin
had time to subside much. That is with a real blade, not our bated
ones. In considering the relative ease of penetrating different parts
of the body, Dr. Knight had this to say:

> It appeared that the resistance depended more upon the underlying
> tissues than upon the skin itself. For instance, the intercostal spaces
> between the ribs could be penetrated much more easily than the upper
> abdomen because the tissues were stretched tightly across the ribs and
> skin did not subside before penetration, as the upper abdomen. Similarly,
> the force required to penetrate the abdominal wall was reduced to at
> least half, when the skin was put under tension before stabbing. The
> skin of large muscular areas such as the thigh was also more easily
> penetrated due to the firm resistance beneath.

It is important to remember that Dr. Knight was
performing his tests on cadavers, and not people poised with muscles taught
to lunge or retreat. The stomach and other soft areas would be under
tension similar to that over the rib cage, and be penetrated equally easily.
The space between ribs is equal to or larger than the ribs themselves.
The oval cross section of the ribs will tend to direct a blade between
them. For the purpose of a fighting standard, it would not be
unreasonable to assume all blows to the ribs pass through. Disregarding
blows because of one's anatomical peculiarities makes great reading in Marvel
Comics, but is not fair or realistic in rapier combat.

In considering the depth of wounds, the article says <I>&quot;Once the
knife penetrated the skin, no further force needed to be applied to cause
rapid penetration of the tissues beneath the skin.&quot;</I> This means
that no matter how skinny or obese the fighter, once the threshold of
the skin is overcome, the blows are equally deadly to both Laurel and
Hardy alike. This fact is further supported in the article by <I>&quot;the
passing of the threshold point caused the knife to suddenly penetrate
deeply into the body, even though the operator attempted to remove the
pressure as soon as a loss of resistance was felt.&quot;</I> Picture the
skin as the surface of a trampoline; when you attempt to puncture it with
a knife the surface dimples downward until the point breaks through, then
the surface jumps up driving itself far up the blade. In other words if
you hit hard enough to penetrate the skin, you hit hard enough to wound
or kill your opponent.

All people are equally easy to puncture, regardless of size or hit location,
with the possible exception of the cranium. This is supported by experiment
and not simply for game play. We believe it is important that we try to do
things in as realistic a manner as possible so we are not simply playing
another kind of game, but portraying a fighting style with a bit of substance.
If you find these conclusions hard to accept we encourage you to carry out
your own research and experiment, and present hard facts in support of your
viewpoint.

### HISTORICAL INJURIES

There are a few historical accounts of duels which may throw a little light
on our attempts at analyses of wounding with rapiers or daggers.

The Frenchman Brantome has an account of a duel with rapier and dagger in
151O, in which a Captain St. Croix received a wound in the thigh (a cut?)
which pierced to the bone. Captain St. Croix fell to the ground and prepared
to defend himself from there. He became faint with loss of blood, his second
offered St. Croix's surrender, and the fight was stopped.

A similar fight between lightly armored opponents using sword and dagger in Rome, in 1559,
got one fighter a serious wound in the leg. The wounded man did not fall,
but retaliated with a hard thrust and two quick cuts, with no success. His
opponent played a defensive fight until the wounded man was about to collapse
from loss of blood, and asked that the duel end.

Two sons of Gianno de Medici fought a duel with sword and cloak. One of them
received a <I>&quot;scratchy on the forehead and was forced to repeatedly wipe blood
from his eyes until his brother stopped the fight and bound up the wound.&quot;</I>
Eventually both were severely wounded but both survived.

On March 31, 1579, a duel took place on the isle of Louviers, on the Seine,
between M. de Sourdiac, the young Lord of Chateauneuf, and the elderly M.
de La Chasnaye-Lalier. Sourdiac had precipitated the duel, but tried to settle
the question peacefully al the site of the duel. Chasnaye insisted that they
had gone to the trouble of setting up the duel, and they were going to do
it. They stripped to their shirts, but Sourdiac planted a shot on Chasnaye
that he thought should have done serious damage, without effect.  Sourdiac
accused his opponent of being secretly armored and began making attacks at
Chasnaye's head and neck. Chasnaye received a thrust in the neck, which narrowly
missed cutting his throat, but persevered and succeeded in running Sourdiac
through and killing him.  Was Chasnaye Lalier really wearing armor? At this
point nobody knows.

In the reign of Emperor Charles V, there was a duel between a pair of Italians
and a pair of Spaniards in the presence of the Emperor and his court. One
of the Italians was wounded early in the fight, and his companion moved to
his aid. Seeing their advantage. the Spaniards redoubled their attack. In
a final flurry, the unwounded Italian ran one Spaniard through the body and
nearly cut the other one's head off with a sudden reversal. We interpret
this move as a thrust through one opponent, followed by a violent draw cut
or slash through the throat of the other, probably a cut through the tissue
of the neck down to the spine. We have probably seen draw cuts of comparable
force on our list fields disregarded.

The point of these stories is that, though we have no way of judging how
hard these fighters were hit, we do have numerous examples of people being
defeated by a substantial leg wound and subsequent loss of blood. This occurrence
is something we seldom do in our play. We have a case in which a fighter
is seriously hampered by a small cut on the forehead, and on the other side,
an account of a duellist receiving a dangerous, but not fatal wounds to the
neck and continues to fight, and wins.

### TEST RESULTS

Based on Dr. Knight's information, Don lolo and I conducted some of our own
experiments. We used split rawhide bends that had been soaking in water for
many hours, and a ten pond (l0 pound) scale modified for the purpose. We
found that the soaked rawhide was penetrated at about the same pressure threshold
as the skin. This is not precise to the ounce, but certainly to the pound,
which should be adequate for our purposes.

Using a very sharp, light rapier (1/2 inch x 3/16 inch cross section), we
were able to penetrate at about 8 pounds in the slow push, and about 1 l/2
pounds in a fast thrust. Using a wide, less sharp rapier (1 1/2 inch x 3/16
inch cross section) we found that penetration took 5 1/2 pounds on a slow
push, and 5 pounds with a fast thrust. This further supports the need for
a very sharp point. Remember, a #5 foil only requires 4 l/2 pounds for a 2
inch bend. To have consistent blow calling in rapier combat, it is necessary
to assume all combatants use similar rapiers of similar sharpness. The 2
inch rule is a good standard. Be aware that speed aids blow calling just
as it aids penetration in a real blade.

It was not difficult to draw cut the soaked rawhide stretched over a curved
surface The amount of pressure required could not be objectively measured,
but it seemed to be about 4 or 5 pounds for a 5 inch draw cut.  This would
be quite sufficient to lay a limb or torso open with a nasty wound.
We also discovered if the point was not thrust squarely, but laid on, it
would not puncture the rawhide, even with 3 very large bend of 6 to 8 inches
with the light rapier. Dragging the laid-on point across the rawhide did
not cut it deeply, but only scratched it.

### TECHNICAL DATA

Note: 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds

Blade #5 foil practice = electric foil Italian epee

| Blade | Pressure required for 2 inch bend |
|----|
| #5 foil | 4.5 pounds |
| Practice electric foil | 5.5 pounds|
| Italian epee | 10 pounds |


| Blade | Pressure for slow penetration | Thrust |
|---|
| gerber dagger | 3.5 pounds |  1.5 pounds |
| light rapier   | 3.5 pounds | 1.5 pounds |
| heavy rapier    | 5.5 pounds | 5.0 pounds |

Note: It does not require 10 pounds to deliver a good blow with an epee,
it simply does not bend as much in delivering a killing blow. The bend of the
#5 foil is simply a way to measure the pressure behind the blade.
Our experiments have given us hard evidence in support of the two inch bend
rule. They have also supported recent efforts to reduce drastically the force
necessary for effective draw cuts- we hope these experiments will help to
foster a new sense of body awareness in rapier combat.

Our research reminded us that the nature of the human body is such that it is often unnecessary
to deliver what we assume is a *killing blow* to vanquish opponents. Contrarily,
we have examples of people who received blows we might have considered
incapacitating and continued to fight. Our rules attempt to fall with the
median of these two extremes. In conclusion we must admit that our system
of counting blows is and must remain rather arbitrary and sometimes unrealistic.
We can and should strive to count blows much more easily. We may also strive
to give support to those who are chivalrous enough to consider loss of bloods
blinding, and other effects of wounding that are not precisely mandated by
the rules. In order to do this, we must emphasize some important elements
of fairness, chivalry, and theater over the need to win within the strict
confines of the rules.
