title: Top 10 reasons Why Rapier Is Not A Sport
---

* Even when Sheep Dog handling and Cheerleading become Olympic sports, rapier won't.
* Our training manuals are 400 years out of print.
* No NCAA sanctions for recruiting violations.
* Our wacky scoring system does not require a stopwatch accurate to one 100th of a second. What kind of a cheesy sport would that be?
* The "babes" & "beefcake" at our events are covered from neck to foot in yards and yards of brocade.
* No "60 Minutes" expose on the rapier/steroid connection.
* No sponsorship offers from Nike -- not even one -- and no Nike brand bucket tops.
* We don't get a spot on ESPN2, even though caber tossing does!
* You generally need to be old, tired and have bad knees to get a White Scarf.
* *If your first priority is winning, you are doing it wrong!*
